# P3FL - Prompt Powered Python Function Library

P3FL (Prompt Powered Python Function Library) is a versatile and powerful library that leverages the power of language models, specifically OpenAI's GPT-3, to create a collection of intelligent and useful Python functions. By utilizing well-crafted prompts, P3FL enables developers to access the power of GPT-3 in a more convenient and efficient manner.

## Features

- A wide range of Python functions backed by GPT-3's language model
- Easy-to-use interface for developers
- Customizable and expandable functions
- Covers various use-cases and applications
- Streamlines the process of integrating GPT-3 into Python projects

## Installation

To install P3FL, simply run the following command:

```
pip install p3fl
```

## Usage

First, ensure that you have an API key for OpenAI's GPT-3. Then, import the desired functions from the P3FL library and use them in your Python project.

```python
import openai
from p3fl import create_cloze, summarize_text, generate_ideas

openai.api_key = 'your-api-key'

# Example usage of create_cloze function
verse_text = "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."
clozed_verse = create_cloze(verse_text)
print(clozed_verse)

# Example usage of summarize_text function
long_text = "A long passage of text that needs summarization..."
summary = summarize_text(long_text)
print(summary)

# Example usage of generate_ideas function
prompt = "Ideas for a sci-fi novel set in a futuristic city"
ideas = generate_ideas(prompt)
print(ideas)
```
